<p>Some of the most pathetic cases of the spiritual
unrest and skepticism of the day are found
among the children of Christian parents. They
have been brought up to believe the Bible, but
under the influences that have met them as they
have gone out from the old home into the world
their early faith has been shaken, and not unfrequently
destroyed. To such as these, and, beyond
these, to all who have come to believe that our
age has passed beyond the Bible, it is hoped that
the incidents and arguments of this little book may
be of service.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear C&mdash;&mdash;</span>: It is useless for you to write to
me on the subject of your last letter. I appreciate
your motives, but with me the question is settled.
I have given up the beliefs of my childhood; they
had long been a burden to me, and the writings
and lectures of Mr. &mdash;&mdash; did the rest. Have you
heard him? Can he be fairly answered? I am
not, indeed, as confident as he is that there is no
personal God, though I do not believe it can be
<em>proved</em>, and I entirely agree with him in abhorring
and rejecting the doctrine of future suffering.
This was the horrible nightmare of my childhood,
and you cannot conceive the relief that the rejection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of the doctrine has given me. I am frank to
say, from my own experience and that of others,
that this is the point that gives Mr. &mdash;&mdash; his hold
on so many. The doctrine of endless suffering for
the sins of this life is abhorrent to them, and they
welcome his views almost as a first truth of reason.
This, at least, is my position. The existence of
God cannot be proved, nor can any immortality
for man except in the influence he may leave behind
him. But a truce to this. Come to me soon
if you are not afraid of my "infidelity," and let
us live over the days of our boyhood. Most of
the dear old friends are gone; we are nearly alone,
and I am not inclined to drop the last links of
brighter, and perhaps better, days than these now
upon us. Yours, truly,</p>

<p class="sig">
A&mdash;&mdash;.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear A&mdash;&mdash;</span>: Your letter has moved me
deeply. Yes, we are almost alone. Of all the
dear group that used to gather in the old school-house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and play upon the common, and stroll along
the river-banks in summer and skate upon its solid
surface in winter, you and I are nearly all that
remain. The Southern sea has poor H&mdash;&mdash;;
W&mdash;&mdash;, the leader of our sports, fell (under another
name, I think) with Custer's band in the
wild tragedy of Montana; B&mdash;&mdash; and S&mdash;&mdash; won
their honors, and were buried with them, on the
battlefield; K&mdash;&mdash; lives a wreck in mind and body.
The rest are scattered. The old homes are all
changed; the inmates are gone from them for ever.</p>

<p>And you are changed. No recollections of the
past that your letter has called up have impressed
me more sadly than the change you speak of in
yourself. You have lost the faith of your childhood.
It is true you do not speak of it as a loss:
you think you have gained by it. Your early
beliefs oppressed you, and you have escaped the
burden by rejecting belief in God and in a future
life.</p>

<p>Let me claim the liberty of an old friend&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
may be for the last time, for we shall soon both
be away&mdash;and ask if you are <em>sure</em> of your ground.
The questions are too momentous, the interests
involved are too great and too lasting, to be risked
on an uncertainty. You are not, indeed, sure that
there is no God, but you are sure that no man can
prove that there is; and you are equally certain
that there can be no future state of suffering for
any. Your final conclusions you have reached
through the influence of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, and you admit
that his hold on you and on others has come largely
through his passionate denials of the doctrine of
future retribution. I have no doubt this is so.
But, after all, is this decisive? Are Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s
doubts and denials more to be relied on than
the positive beliefs of as intelligent and good
men as the world has ever seen? I do not press
this as proof one way or the other, but it is
something worth thinking of before you give
up for ever your respect for Christianity and the
Bible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Your letter has called up memories that will
not down at the bidding. You remember your
mother; you remember her life; you remember
her death. The day after her burial we were sitting,
you and I, under the old willow on the bank
of the river&mdash;it is all before me now&mdash;and you
told me how she died with her hand on your head,
and how before she died you promised to meet her
again. Was it all a delusion? Did she go out in
final darkness? And was your promise the folly
of childhood?</p>

<p>Will you bear with me if I recall another and
a later scene? The days of childhood were behind
us. We had drifted apart. You remained among
the old home-scenes; I was making my way among
strangers. Then one went from you who had become
dearer to you than a mother. I have before
me a letter that came to me out of the shadows of
that bitter trial; I know you will not misjudge me
if I quote its words now. Thus you wrote: "I
am sure such a life cannot have ended; the possibilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of it cannot yet be finished. That soul,
with all its sweetness and beauty and brightness,
cannot have been quenched like a spark on the
ocean.... Her last words were, 'I go with
Him who has brought life and immortality to
light, and who has opened the kingdom of heaven
to all believers.'" I would not recall these early
views and faiths unkindly. If they were wrong,
of course you are right in parting with them; but
is it certain they were wrong? And in giving
them up have you found something better and
more sure to take their place?</p>

<p>One important point I presume you have not
overlooked: whatever doubts there may be as to
the existence of God, <em>atheism can never be proved</em>.
No man can ever be sure that there is <em>not</em> a God;
he may deny that the proof of divine existence
satisfies <em>him</em>, but that is all he can do. Somewhere
in the universe, after all, God may be. No man
has explored all its recesses; none has pierced its
limitless heights; none has threaded all its dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
abysses and found that in it all there is no God.
A man must himself have the attributes of God to
know that there is no God. And suppose I cannot
prove that there is a God? If I live as if there
were one and it should happen that there is not, I
am safe; I lose nothing. But if I live as if there
were no God and it should come to pass at last that
there is, where am I? Of two untraveled paths,
it is wisest to take that which is <em>known</em> to be
safe.</p>

<p>But suppose it to be a question of probabilities.
Suppose you have to choose between an endless succession
of finite causes, as a man, an oak, a flower,
a dewdrop&mdash;not one of which is adequate to its
own existence&mdash;and one infinite, eternal self-existent,
almighty and allwise Cause of all things
(and some such choice sooner or later you must
make), which is the better? Which is the more
reasonable? If you think through these questions
at all, either you must at last admit a God or you
must make something for yourself that will do the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
work of God; and the God you make <em>must do
what actually is done now</em>; what he will do hereafter,
who can say? Your friend, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, tells
you that "all there is is all the God there is"&mdash;that
"the universe is all there is or was or will be."
This is pantheistic atheism; it is a mere assertion
without a particle of proof; and if true, it can give
us no relief for the future, as I hope to satisfy
you.</p>

<p>By the side of this utterance of Mr. &mdash;&mdash; let me
put the words of that king in the realm of science,
Professor Joseph Henry. They are found in the
last letter that he ever wrote, and may be taken as
the final summing up of all those vast researches
that have made his name the heritage of the world.
They are entitled to some weight as against the
statements of men who, if they can follow in his
footsteps at all, must follow afar off. These are his
words: "After all our speculations and an attempt
to grapple with the problem of the universe, the
simplest conception which explains and connects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the phenomena is that of the existence of one
spiritual Being infinite in wisdom, in power and
all divine perfections." That is, the simplest and
the best explanation of the facts of the universe is
found in the existence of God. This is testimony
accepted by the highest scientific authority both in
this country and in Europe. I do not say that it
proves there is a God, but it does prove that belief
in God is consistent with the highest intellectual
power. To disbelieve is no proof of a great mind.</p>

<p>Mr. &mdash;&mdash; eulogizes Thomas Paine as one of the
greatest and best men of his age&mdash;a man "whose
writings carry conviction to the dullest." Now,
Paine, though a bitter enough infidel, as we all
know, never so parted from his reason or his reverence
as to deny the existence of God. He says
with a force that, according to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, must
"carry conviction to the dullest:" "I know I did
not make myself, and yet I have existence; and by
searching into the nature of other things I find no
other thing could make itself, and yet millions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
other things exist; therefore it is that I know by
positive conclusions resulting from this search that
there is a power superior to all these things, and
that power is God." Paine believed in God; he
believed in a future life; he believed in the person
of Christ, of whom Mr. &mdash;&mdash; so far takes leave
of all historic judgment, and even of all respectable
infidel judgments, as to say we do not know
that he ever existed!</p>

<p>This suggests a word in regard to your questions
whether I have heard Mr. &mdash;&mdash; and whether he
can be fairly answered. I have never heard him
on the subjects of which you speak, but I have
read enough, I think, to judge him fairly. I recognize
his brilliant gifts, his wit, his rhetorical
power, but I am surprised that one of your
natural clearness of mind should not see that he
deals most unfairly with the questions of religion.
His representation of Christianity is a caricature,
and it takes great charity not to believe it is an
<em>intentional</em> caricature. His treatment of the Scriptures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
is inexcusably unfair. If a Christian were
to deal with an infidel book as Mr. &mdash;&mdash; deals with
the Bible, there would be no bound to the charges
of outrageous misrepresentation and perversion.
His abuse of Christians and Christianity is often
more like the raving of a madman than like the
calm judgment of a fair-minded reasoner. What
are we to think of a man who can sit down
and deliberately write and send out to the world
such words as these?&mdash;"Hundreds, and thousands,
and millions, have lost their reason in contemplating
the monstrous falsehoods of Christianity;"
"Nine-tenths of the people in the penitentiaries
are believers;" "The orthodox Christian says that
if he can only save his little soul, if he can barely
squeeze into heaven, ... it matters not to him
what becomes of brother or sister, father or mother,
wife or child. He is willing that they should burn
if he can sing." This is enough. But what shall
be said of such ravings? Suppose Mr. &mdash;&mdash; finds
imperfections in the Church; suppose he finds a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
multitude of professed Christians that are not what
they should be, just as Christ has given us reason
to expect,&mdash;does that settle the real nature of Christianity?
Suppose "nine-tenths of the people in
the penitentiaries" were American citizens,&mdash;does
that prove that American citizenship is a bad thing
or make it worth while for a man to spend his life
in denouncing our Constitution? Mr. &mdash;&mdash; knows
there is a very different kind of citizen, and he
knows that these men are in the penitentiary, not
because they have kept the laws of their country,
but because they have broken them. So, even if
the monstrous assertion were true that nine-tenths
of the occupants of the penitentiaries are Christian
professors, they are there, not on account of
Christianity, but in spite of it. True Christianity
never sent them there, and every honest man knows
that. Christianity is founded on Christ, and the
required fruit of it is holiness, rectitude with man
and purity before God. This is a fact that any
man who <em>wants</em> to know the truth can understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
by an hour's study of the teachings of Christ and
his apostles.</p>

<p>To your question whether Mr. &mdash;&mdash; can be answered,
I say deliberately he has been answered a
hundred times. I do not think that in all his assaults
on the Bible he has advanced a respectable argument
or objection that has not been urged and answered
again and again long before he was born. The
Christian Church has not the least fear for herself
from his attacks; indeed, she understands them so
well, and has repelled them so often, that she is
perhaps too indifferent to anything he may say.
The danger is not to the Church, but to those <em>who
want to be convinced that the Bible is not true, and
who want to be assured that, however they may live in
this life, they have nothing to fear in a life to come</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_II" id="LETTER_II">LETTER II.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">My Dear A&mdash;&mdash;</span>: The two questions that press
upon every mind, and that Mr. &mdash;&mdash; has shown
again and again, with wonderful pathos, by dying
beds and at open graves, are pressing upon his, are
these: Is there a God? Is there a future state of
existence? To these questions the best answer
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; has to give is, "We do not know." He
seems confident that there is no personal God, and
"we cannot say whether death is a wall or a door,
the beginning or the end of a day, the spreading of
pinions to soar or the folding for ever of wings, the
rise or the set of a sun." With all this uncertainty,
he is absolutely sure that there is no future state of
suffering for evil-doers. He does not know whether
there is any future at all, but he does know that
there is no future of sorrow. He is profoundly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
ignorant as to the <em>fact</em> of a future, but has decisive
knowledge as to the <em>nature</em> of the future, if there
is one. "Rather than that this doctrine of endless
punishment should be true," he says, "I would
gladly see the fabric of our civilization, crumbling,
fall to unmeaning chaos and to formless dust, where
oblivion broods and even memory forgets."</p>

<p>Now, it may be quite true that Mr. &mdash;&mdash; has this
preference, yet this does not settle the case. We
can fully understand how any man should shrink
from the terrible possibility of future suffering.
Orthodoxy has no more delight in it than has infidelity.
But it is not a question of preference: it
is a question of fact; and the point I submit for
your reflection is this&mdash;whether Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, on his
own ground, is authorized to affirm that there is no
future state of suffering for any. He says we do
not know whether there <em>is</em> any future state. Very
well. Then, certainly, we do not know what <em>kind</em>
of a future state there may be, if there is one. If
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; is not able to assure us that there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
future for us at all, he surely has not the ground to
assure us of any kind of a future, good or bad.
There may be a future of joy, there may be a
future of suffering; there may be both. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;
is too good a lawyer to undertake to prove anything
by mere negative evidence. He "leaves the
dead with Nature, the mother of all," and "Nature,"
as to any sure utterance upon the future, is
as silent as are the lips of the dead themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. &mdash;&mdash; does not believe in a personal God.
<em>You</em> are not sure whether there is one or not.
There may be; there may be none. If there is,
we cannot know it. Let us see what we gain on
either supposition.</p>

<p>Suppose there is a God, though I cannot know it
or I cannot know him. Then, clearly, I cannot
know what he is; I cannot know what he may do.
It is quite possible that this unknown God may be
a God who hates what we call sin, and who will
punish it, and who will punish it just as long as it
stands an offence in the moral universe, whether it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
be in this world or in the world to come. No
agnosticism can deny this conclusion. The darkest
as well as the most radiant scenes that Christian
faith brings within our view <em>may</em> be eternally true.
I may be immortal, and it may be an immortality
of joy or of sighing for me as I use this life and
the truth that God has made known to me in this
life.</p>

<p>Let us take the other hypothesis. Suppose there
is no God; suppose Mr. &mdash;&mdash; has satisfied me
that there is no supernatural revelation, and no
personal God to make one. Has he made it well
for me hereafter? Has he delivered me from all
fear for the future? Has he saved me beyond
question from "the serpent of eternal pain"? If
there is no God, does that make it certain that there
will be no future suffering for any man? Let us
see. We are here in a world of suffering. How
came we here? and how did suffering come here?
If we came without a God, who will prove that
without a God we may not go elsewhere, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
suffering may not go with us? Here we are&mdash;by
natural law, by evolution, by chance&mdash;as part and
particle of the one eternal unity; however it may
be, we are here, and we suffer. We know what
pain of body and pain of mind are. We have felt
the sting of death, and no law of nature, no power
of evolution, has ever lighted up for us the darkness
of the grave. Now, the question we want
answered is this: If "Nature" has brought us into
this state where there is so much of what we call
sin, and so much bound with it that we call suffering,
how do we know that the same "Nature" may
not continue the same facts hereafter? Nay, what
assurance can Mr. &mdash;&mdash; give us that "Nature" is
not a power that may in some future frenzy cast us
into a state <em>far worse</em> than the present? Is he so
far possessed of all the secrets of "Nature" that
he <em>knows</em> the time will never come when she may
strike us with a force more terrible than any retributive
judgment of God? If "Nature" works
now in storm and fire, in earthquake and pestilence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in disease and torture and death, in the sorrows of
memory, the horrors of remorse and dread forebodings
of coming woe, <em>how do you know that she
may not manifest herself thus hereafter and through
the ages to come</em>?</p>

<p>If Nature is, as Mr. &mdash;&mdash; says, the mother of
us all, there are times when she manifests her
motherhood appallingly. And when are these
manifestations to end and how are they to end?
If under her regal sway we find that, as a fact, sin
and suffering are connected here, can any man
prove that it may not be a law of "Nature" herself
that sin and suffering shall be connected eternally?
If in the imperial reign of "the mother
of us all" there are chains and scourges, prisons
and scaffolds, thunderbolts and flames, cyclones and
famines and ocean-graves, will any man prove that
somewhere in the darkness and mystery of the
future there may not be, in the long outworking of
this reign, something worse than a hell, worse than
an undying worm, worse than a quenchless fire?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>It is, I admit, a fearful thing to fall unprepared
into the hands of the living God; but if I must
choose, give me that, a thousand times, rather than
the terrific possibilities that overhang us all if we
are to be eternally at the disposal of a blind, inexorable,
soulless, merciless "Nature." The Judge of
all the earth will do right; at the worst we shall
receive no more at his hands than we deserve; but
no created being can tell us what we shall receive
at the hands of an irresponsible, pitiless "Nature"
though she be "the mother of us all." There is
nothing so dark and terrible in all the woes of the
Bible as the possibilities that Mr. &mdash;&mdash; offers us in
his gospel; and there is this difference: the Bible
opens wide a door of hope for all who care to enter
it; Mr. &mdash;&mdash; leads us out into the outer darkness
and leaves us there. Is it worth while for any
man to spend his life in persuading us to make this
exchange of despair? And is it worth our while&mdash;yours
or mine&mdash;to make it?</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_III" id="LETTER_III">LETTER III.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">My Dear A&mdash;&mdash;</span>: In the note in which you
kindly acknowledge my former communications
you say that, whatever Christianity may be to me,
you cannot see it as I do; its excellences, as they
appear to my mind, do not impress you at all, and
as long as they do not you cannot be expected to
accept it. I admit the conclusion: you cannot receive
as good and true what does not seem to be so.
But does it follow that a thing is not good and
true because you do not see it? The question still
comes, Is the cause in the thing or in you?</p>

<p>You remember the Beethoven concert we once
attended together in B&mdash;&mdash;? To you it was an
occasion of exquisite enjoyment; to me it was
nothing. The difference was not in the music: it
was in us. You have a musical taste; I have not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
I tried&mdash;not very sincerely, perhaps&mdash;to persuade
you that there was nothing beautiful in it; you
smiled, but attempted no argument. You were
wise. You knew the music was beautiful, for you
had experienced it; you had felt its power. If I
chose to deny it because I had not felt it, so it must
be; you could only pity me.</p>

<p>Now, is it not possible that there may be something
like this in religion? May it not be a reality&mdash;a
supreme reality&mdash;though you do not see it or
feel it? May I not know it to be real because I
have felt its power? And if there are thousands
and tens of thousands as intelligent men and
women as the world has ever seen who are as ready
to testify that they have felt the power and experienced
the reality of the Christian religion as you are
to testify that you have felt the power and know
the sweetness of music, are you wise to dismiss its
claims because <em>you</em> have not felt the force of them?
You must see this. I leave it to your candor.
Christianity may be true though you have not felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
its truth. A cloud of witnesses stand ready to testify
to you its truth from personal experience.
They may not argue with you: multitudes of them
could not argue with you; but, after all, they have
a proof of the reality of their religion, of the
power of Christ to satisfy and bless men, which no
arguments in the world can shake. If all this
were a new thing, or if the witnesses were only
ignorant and superstitious men, you might well
enough hesitate to receive the testimony; but when
you reflect that it is the accumulated testimony of
nearly nineteen centuries, that it comes from all
countries and all classes, from the prince on the
throne and the beggar at his gate, from the philosopher
in his study and the sailor in the forecastle,
from the statesman in the cabinet and the ploughman
in the furrow, I submit it cannot with wisdom
or reason be set aside. It is no answer to say that
many great men and learned men and ploughmen
can be brought who have had no such experience
and give no such testimony. This is true, but it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
one of the first laws of evidence that no amount
of merely negative testimony can overthrow the
explicit evidence of honest, intelligent, trustworthy
witnesses. Fifty men who did not see a murder
could not set aside the clear testimony of two who
did see it. Few of the race have ever seen the
moons of Mars, or even of Jupiter; this does not
disturb the witness of the few who have: the satellites
are there.</p>

<p>I have just been reading&mdash;not for the first time&mdash;Peter
Harvey's account of his visit, with Daniel
Webster, to John Colby. You will find it in Harvey's
<cite>Reminiscences of Webster</cite>; and if you have
not read it, it is worth your reading. Colby had
married Webster's oldest sister when Webster was
a mere boy. It was in some respects a strange
marriage. She was a godly, Christian woman,
while Colby was a wild, reckless, ungodly man&mdash;"the
wickedest man in the neighborhood," Webster
believed, "as far as swearing and impiety
went." He seems to have been the terror of Webster's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
boyhood. Singularly enough for New England,
though a man of strong natural powers, he
never learned to read till he was over eighty years
of age. His wife died early, and the families
drifted apart. Webster had not seen Colby for
over forty years, but he heard that a great change
had taken place with him, and he visited him to
judge for himself. I should mar the story of the
interview if I undertook to condense it. Let me
give the essential parts of it in Mr. Harvey's own
words. Long as it is, I think you would be sorry
to have it shorter.</p>

<p>Webster and Harvey had driven to Andover,
and were directed to Mr. Colby's house. "The
door was open.... Sitting in the middle of the
room was a striking figure who proved to be John
Colby. He sat facing the door, in a very comfortably
furnished farmhouse room, with a little table&mdash;or
what perhaps would be called a light-stand&mdash;before
him. Upon it was a large, old-fashioned Scott's
Family Bible in very large print, and, of course, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
heavy volume. It lay open, and he had evidently
been reading it attentively. As we entered he took
off his spectacles and laid them upon the page of
the book, and looked up at us as we approached,
Mr. Webster in front. He was a man, I should
think, over six feet in height, and he retained in a
wonderful degree his erect and manly form, although
he was eighty-five or six years old. His
frame was that of a once powerful, athletic man.
His head was covered with very heavy, thick, bushy
hair, and it was as white as wool, which added very
much to the picturesqueness of his appearance. As
I looked in at the door I thought I never saw a
more striking figure. He straightened himself up,
but said nothing till just as we appeared at the
door, when he greeted us with&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Walk in, gentlemen.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Webster's first salutation was&mdash;</p>

<p>"'This is Mr. Colby&mdash;Mr. John Colby&mdash;is it
not?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"'That is my name, sir,' was the reply.</p>

<p>"'I suppose you don't know me?' said Mr.
Webster.</p>

<p>"'No, sir, I don't know you; and I should like
to know how you know me.'</p>

<p>"'I have seen you before, Mr. Colby,' replied
Mr. Webster.</p>

<p>"'Seen me before!' said he; 'pray, when and
where?'</p>

<p>"'Have you no recollection of me?' asked Mr.
Webster.</p>

<p>"'No, sir, not the slightest;' and he looked by
Mr. Webster toward me, as if trying to remember
if he had seen me.</p>

<p>"Mr. Webster remarked,</p>

<p>"'I think you never saw this gentleman before,
but you have seen me.'</p>

<p>"Colby put the question again,</p>

<p>"'When and where?'</p>

<p>"'You married my oldest sister,' replied Mr.
Webster, calling her by name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I married your oldest sister!' exclaimed Colby.
'Who are you?'</p>

<p>"'I am "little Dan,"' was the reply.</p>

<p>"It certainly would be impossible to describe the
expression of wonder, astonishment and half incredulity
that came over Colby's face.</p>

<p>"'<em>You</em> Daniel Webster!' said he; and he started
to rise from his chair. As he did so he stammered
out some words of surprise. 'Is it possible that
this is the little black lad that used to ride the horse
to water? Well, I cannot realize it!'</p>

<p>"Mr. Webster approached him. They embraced
each other, and both wept.</p>

<p>"'Is it possible,' said Mr. Colby, when the embarrassment
of the first shock of recognition was past,
'that you have come up here to see me? Is this
Daniel? Why! why!' said he, 'I cannot believe my
senses. Now, sit down. I am glad&mdash;oh, I am so
glad to see you, Daniel. I never expected to see you
again. I don't know what to say. I am so glad
that my life has been spared that I might see you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Why, Daniel, I read about you and hear about you
in all ways. Sometimes some members of the
family come and tell us about you, and the newspapers
tell us a great deal about you, too. Your
name seems to be constantly in the newspapers.
They say that you are a great man&mdash;that you are
a famous man&mdash;and you can't tell how delighted
I am when I hear such things. But, Daniel, the
time is short; you will not stay here long: I want
to ask you one important question. You may be a
<em>great</em> man: are you a <em>good</em> man? Are you a Christian
man? Do you love the Lord Jesus Christ?
That is the only question that is worth asking or
answering? Are you a Christian? You know,
Daniel, what I have been: I have been one of the
wickedest of men. Your poor sister, who is now
in heaven, knows that. But the Spirit of Christ
and of almighty God has come down and plucked
me as a brand from the everlasting burning. I am
here now, a monument to his grace. Oh, Daniel, I
would not give what is contained within the covers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of this book for all the honors that have been conferred
upon men from the creation of the world
until now. For what good would it do? It is all
nothing, and less than nothing, if you are not a
Christian, if you are not repentant. If you do not
love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity and truth,
all your worldly honors will sink to utter nothingness.
Are you a Christian? Do you love Christ?
You have not answered me.'</p>

<p>"All this was said in the most earnest and even
vehement manner.</p>

<p>"'John Colby,' replied Mr. Webster, 'you have
asked me a very important question, and one which
should not be answered lightly. I intend to give
you an answer, and one that is truthful, or I will
not give you any. I hope that I am a Christian.
I profess to be a Christian. But, while I say that,
I wish to add&mdash;and I say it with shame and confusion
of face&mdash;that I am not such a Christian as I
wish I were. I have lived in the world, surrounded
by its honors and its temptations, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
am afraid, John Colby, that I am not so good a
Christian as I ought to be. I am afraid I have
not your faith and your hopes; but still I hope
and trust that I am a Christian, and that the same
grace which has converted you and made you an
heir of salvation will do the same for me. I trust
it, and I also trust, John Colby&mdash;and it will not be
long before our summons will come&mdash;that we shall
meet in a better world, and meet those who have
gone before us whom we knew, and who trusted in
that same divine free grace. It will not be long.
You cannot tell, John Colby, how much delight it
gave me to hear of your conversion. The hearing
of that is what has led me here to-day. I came here
to see with my own eyes and hear with my own
ears the story from a man that I know and remember
so well. What a wicked man you used to
be!'</p>

<p>"'Oh, Daniel,' exclaimed John Colby, 'you
don't remember how wicked I was, how ungrateful
I was, how unthankful I was. I never thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
God; I never cared for God; I was worse than a
heathen. Living in a Christian land with the light
shining all around me and the blessings of Sabbath
teachings everywhere about me, I was worse than a
heathen until I was arrested by the grace of Christ
and made to see my sinfulness and to hear the voice
of my Saviour. Now I am only waiting to go
home to him, and to meet your sainted sister, my
poor wife. And I wish, Daniel, that you might
be a prayerful Christian; and I trust you are.
Daniel,' he added, with deep earnestness of voice,
'Will you pray with me?'</p>

<p>"We knelt down, and Mr. Webster offered a
most touching prayer. As soon as he had pronounced
the 'Amen,' Mr. Colby followed in a most
pathetic, stirring appeal to God. He prayed for
the family, for me and for everybody. Then we
rose, and he seemed to feel a serene happiness in
having thus joined his spirit with that of Mr.
Webster in prayer....</p>

<p>"The brothers-in-law took an affectionate leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of each other, and we left. Mr. Webster could
hardly restrain his tears. When we got into the
wagon, he began to moralize:</p>

<p>"'I should like,' said he, 'to know what the
enemies of religion would say to John Colby's conversion.
There was a man as unlikely, humanly
speaking, to become a Christian as any man I ever
saw. He was reckless, heedless, impious&mdash;never
attended church, never experienced the good influence
of associating with religious people&mdash;and here
he has been living on in that reckless way until
he has got to be an old man, until a period of life
when you naturally would not expect his habits to
change, and yet he has been brought into the condition
in which we have seen him to-day, a penitent,
trusting, humble believer. Whatever people
may say,' added Mr. Webster, 'nothing can convince
me that anything short of the grace of almighty
God could make such a change as I with
my own eyes have witnessed in the life of John
Colby.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Colby was eighty-four years old at the time
of his conversion. At that age he learned to read
for the single purpose of reading the Bible, and it
was the only book he ever did read. He lived for
three years after this, and to the end gave the clearest
evidences of a change that to Mr. Webster's
judicial mind could be explained only by the supposition
of a divine interposition; it was a divine
reality. The last intelligible words of the once
terrible blasphemer were, "Jesus! glory!"</p>

<p>Changing the details, the experience of John
Colby has been the experience of thousands upon
thousands. And&mdash;I put it to you in all candor&mdash;is
it all a lie? Was Webster&mdash;one of the grandest
intellects of this or of any age&mdash;was he a
fanatic or a fool to believe in the reality of the
religion that John Colby had experienced? Was
he a weakling to put his faith where John Colby
had put his, and to trust that when the summons
of both should come&mdash;as it soon did come&mdash;they
might meet each other and those who had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
before them trusting in the same divine, free
grace?</p>

<p>You may criticise the Bible, you may criticise
Christians, but, after all, there is something in
Christianity that cannot be explained away as a
superstition or a delusion; there is something that
cannot be dismissed by a scoff or with indifference.
Somewhere and at some time it will have the final
word, and it will be heard. I commend it to your
honest and earnest judgment now. Try it; I ask
no more. Settle the great questions that press on
every heart as the Bible opens the way of settlement
to you, and wait the issue. You can lose
nothing; you may gain everything. The fact is
as remarkable as it is familiar that no man in the
last hour here&mdash;the hour, often, of supernal light&mdash;ever
wanted to take back or to change his faith
in the Man of Nazareth as the Son of God and the
Saviour of men. When the shadows are melting
in the great realities, and the mysteries of life are
about to be finished and the verities of the future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
are to be proved, no man has yet been found to
mourn that in the face of all difficulty and doubt
and denial here he was a Christian. Can that, or
anything approaching it, be said of any form of
atheism or infidelity or unbelief?</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_IV" id="LETTER_IV">LETTER IV.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">My Dear A&mdash;&mdash;</span>: I had supposed my last letter
would end our correspondence. Your kind reply
has gratified me more than I can express. Without
further words, let me take up at once the question
that you put, I am sure, sincerely. You ask,
"What <em>is</em> 'the way of settlement that the Bible
opens to the great questions that press us?'"</p>

<p>The questions of supreme interest are few and
simple. Is there a God? Is there a future existence
for us? How can that existence be made a
safe and satisfying one? If you are willing to
allow any authority to the Bible at all, there can be
no doubt as to the first two questions. There is a
God by whom we were created and to whom we
are responsible; there is a future existence. Those
two questions are settled, if the Bible can settle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
anything. And they are settled, let me add, in
harmony with the profoundest instincts and the
most imperative demands of our nature. Whatever
a few souls in their struggling dissatisfaction
and sad unrest may persuade themselves, the great
yearning heart of humanity will quiet itself on
nothing less than God and immortality. Even
your former guide, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; (let me hope I may
speak of him now as only your <em>former</em> guide), cries
out in the presence of the dead and before the
awful silence of the grave, "<em>Immortality</em> is a word
that hope through all the ages has been whispering
to love. All wish for happiness beyond this life;
all hope to meet again the loved and lost." Yes,
there are hours when the most hopeless are glad to
turn to the hope that the Bible alone gives, when the
bitterest rejecters of God and his word long for
the consolation that only the rejected word affords.</p>

<p>Let us turn to the other question. If, when we
are through with this life&mdash;as we soon shall be
through with it&mdash;we are not through with existence&mdash;if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
there is a life beyond the present not
measured by years or ages,&mdash;how can it be made
worth having? Is there any way in which our
immortality can be assured to us as an immortal
good? After all the doubts and darkness, the
mystery and suffering, the bitterness and disappointment,
of this life, may it in any way be found
a great and a good thing, after all, that we have
lived? To answer these questions we must come
back to the old truth&mdash;the truth of your childhood.
The "advanced thought" of our day has discovered
nothing to change the fact that men are out of
the way, they are not what they should be. Every
man knows this. The Bible expresses it in a very
plain way by saying <em>they are sinners</em>. As such it
deals with them; to such alone it opens its door of
hope. The Bible is of no use to you unless you
are a sinner. If you call this cant, I am sorry
for it, but I cannot help it; I cannot change
it. The only men for whom God is dealing here
for good, for whom he is making possible an immortality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of honor and happiness, are the sinful.
And is not this well for us? Does it not at once
bring hope to you&mdash;a hope as great as it is mysterious?
You know that life has not been to you
an unstained thing any more than it has been to
any of us. To know this is to know sin, the one
appalling fact of the universe, the one unspeakable
woe of our being.</p>

<p>In the simplest way, then, my dear A&mdash;&mdash;, let
me say that the first step in your coming right with
God, and so right with the future, is to know and
to feel that you are wrong. The Bible closes the
door of hope for ever on the man who comes claiming
the brightness and the good of a life beyond the
grave because he is worthy of it. These words were
once familiar to you: "By the deeds of the law
there shall no flesh be justified." Rom. iii. 20.</p>

<p>Can he who is wrong make himself right? Can
he be all he ought to be? Can he do all he ought
to do? Can you set right all the wrong and all
the failure of the past? Can you make the future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
without error? To ask these questions is to answer
them to every honest conscience.</p>

<p>For one who is wrong there must be the consequences
of wrong, and these must be as fearful and
as far-reaching as sin itself. "Whatsoever a man
soweth, that shall he also reap," and evermore and
everywhere the harvest is greater than the seed.
The coming tribulation and anguish of the unsaved
souls that do evil is a law of nature as well as of
revelation. The wages of sin is death. You know
this. You have felt it in its measure. You have
seen it in the unhappiness, the misery, the woe, the
despair and death with which sin reigns everywhere
around us. Take the brightest view of life
that you can, and the darkness in which it ends is
terrible. To go out of it without God is to go out
without hope. Am I wrong in believing that you
need no argument here, that no conviction is more
sorrowfully intense with you than this?</p>

<p>Will you go now a step farther? Standing in
your wrong and your weakness and your unrest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
with the heavy shadows of the future falling upon
you, are you willing to draw near to the open portal
of a better life? Are you willing to look up
and read over it&mdash;"God so loved the world that he
gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
in him should not perish, but have everlasting life"?
John iii. 16. Are you willing to submit your faith
to the mystery&mdash;beyond all depth except the love
of God&mdash;that the Son of God in our nature has
borne our sins in his own body on the tree&mdash;that he
has died for us, the Just for the unjust? In other
words, are you willing to receive the kingdom of
heaven as a little child&mdash;to be saved, if saved you
may be, in God's own way?</p>

<p>In a former letter I spoke of the testimony of
Webster to the reality of the Christian religion;
and, though it is true that Christianity does not
depend upon the patronage of any man, it is well
to know that greater intellects than those that
would persuade you to reject it have bowed before
it and found their supreme hope in it. Let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
give you, then, another testimony from this greatest
of American statesmen and jurists. It was his
last night on earth; that life of extraordinary
influence and honor was closing. As his family
and friends stood around his bed his physician
repeated the immortal hymn of Cowper:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"There is a fountain filled with blood<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Drawn from Immanuel's veins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lose all their guilty stains."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>As upon the night-air died away the final stanza&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Then in a nobler, sweeter song<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'll sing thy power to save<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When this poor, lisping, stammering tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lies silent in the grave,"<br /></span>
</div>

<p>the majestic voice that had thrilled courts and
senates, was heard in a clear thrice-repeated
"Amen! Amen! Amen!" And so he passed, let
us hope, to have part in that final song. Pity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
infinite pity, that he had not made more of that
magnificent intellect for the Giver of it! But at
least he was too great a man to deny the Love and
the Sacrifice by which alone the life of the greatest
as well as the feeblest can be saved from being
an eternal tragedy.</p>

<p>I know, my dear A&mdash;&mdash;, the derision with
which all this may be received, but my hope is
that you have passed beyond that point of intellectual
self-conceit and moral self-murder. At all
events, this is the only ground of a safe immortality
that the Bible holds out, and beyond the
Bible there is no ground. If you ever settle safely
the solemn questions of the future, you will settle
them here. If you ever find the rest for which I
know you are weary, you will find it at the cross
and in the presence of Him who hung upon it, and
whose words are to-day, as of old, "Come unto
me, and I will give you rest."</p>

<p>In all this I know there is nothing new to you.
I had nothing new to say; I wished simply to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
make a plea for the faith of your earlier years. It
is easy to put it aside, but, after all, it is a faith that
will stand. The evidence of nineteen centuries
from millions of honest and intelligent witnesses,
of all ranks and conditions, living and dying, to
the power of this faith to sustain in the most
solemn crises of life, when flesh and heart are failing,
and when the darkness and anguish and mystery
of death are rocking the soul to its foundations,
cannot wisely be dismissed as a delusion: there
must be a reality behind it. The lights that have
gone out from your own home and heart you were
right in believing have "not gone out in darkness,"
but you will not forget that as they went into purer
light they went with Him who has brought life and
immortality to light, who is the Resurrection and
the Life, in whom believing, though we were dead,
yet shall we live.</p>

<p>Here I must rest. I can only commend you to
God and to the word of his grace&mdash;to the written
word and to the incarnate Word, to the Bible and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to Christ. I am as certain as I am of my own
existence that if you will give yourself up to the
guidance of these you will be satisfied and you will
be saved. If you will only take the Bible <em>and
follow it</em>, you will find an assurance of its truth
that cannot be shaken; you will find rest, for you
will find Christ. And surely it is not too much to
ask that in a matter of such infinite importance
you make a fair, honest and thorough trial of that
which no man ever yet made trial of to be disappointed.</p>

<p>Yet let me not fail to impress as a final thought
that this result of good and of peace will come <em>only
by the power of the Holy Spirit</em>. It is his to take
of the things of Christ and show them to us;
unless he does this, we cannot see them. My last
word of entreaty, then, is&mdash;and I would make it as
earnestly as conviction and feeling and language
can make it&mdash;yield to the Spirit of God. The end
you want is too great for your own strength. You
have proved this. You have struggled on long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
enough in your own plans and your own way, seeking
rest, and you are as far from rest as ever. Try
now another way. Take hold of a higher strength.
"Ask, and ye shall receive; seek, and ye shall
find." I plead with you by all the memories of
the past and by all the hopes of the future. You
have sinned, and I would not heal the hurt slightly.
No one knows better than you that if the Bible is
true you have a long and dark account against you&mdash;if
not of open and flagrant sin, yet to the Mind
that makes no mistakes of that which is perhaps
far worse, of calm, deliberate, persistent rejection
of Christ and of his Spirit. It would be faithlessness
and cruelty to hide the fact that by all the
verities of God you are in peril&mdash;in fearful peril.
To stand in darkness where no light is is sad
enough; but when Light is come into the world
and men stand in darkness, there is sin that seals
its own doom. As the case is now, the very unrest
of your soul&mdash;its dark gropings, its unsatisfied
yearnings, its sighs of despair&mdash;all this is the living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
witness of your danger, the prophecy of a
deeper gloom and woe to come.</p>

<p>But as yet it is also the voice of God's mercy;
it is the plea of his Spirit calling you to the only
rest that the universe has for the erring and the
sinful. The Spirit of God is very pitiful. Every
thought of good is from him; every desire for a
better life is his inspiration; every penitent sigh is
his breath. I believe he is not far from you; I
believe, therefore, you are not far from the kingdom
of heaven. Quench not the Spirit. Do not
go down in darkness in sight of the City of
Light.</p>

<p>You remember the circumstances of our return
from Europe in the fall of 18&mdash;. We were young
then, but the events are still vivid in my memory,
as they are no doubt in yours. For two days we
were delayed in Liverpool by a fearful storm. In
that storm the Royal Charter was coming in, having
made successfully the voyage of the world.
She had been signaled, and was already in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Channel; her arrival was looked for every hour.
Dear friends of those we were leaving were on
board. The fires were lighted on the hearth, and
the table was spread for the long-absent ones, and
glad hearts were waiting impatiently to give them
joyful welcome. But they never came; in sight
of the harbor and of the lights of home they went
down&mdash;the four hundred of that doomed ship.
The next day we passed the silent wreck as we
came out, and I am sure you thought, as I did,
how unutterably sad and pathetic is such an end,
to perish in sight of home.</p>

<p>Our voyage, dear A&mdash;&mdash;, is almost over. The
harbor is near; the lights of the eternal home are in
sight; the table is spread, and dear ones&mdash;yours and
mine&mdash;are waiting there to give us glad and everlasting
welcome. Do not make wreck of life and
hope and immortality in the very sight of home.</p>

<p class="center">
Yours, in the bonds of early years,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Since these letters were written, he to whom they
were addressed has gone where human arguments
and pleadings cannot reach him. In a moment, in
the twinkling of an eye, he passed from the scenes
of a busy, honored and prosperous life into the
solemn mysteries that lie beyond our horizon. On
his desk was found the following unfinished letter,
written the night before his death:</p>



<p class="space-above">
<span class="smcap">My Dear C&mdash;&mdash;</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>I have not misapprehended
the spirit and motive of your letters. I have read
them&mdash;more than once&mdash;with care and, I believe,
with candor. When a man stands in the shadow
of a great and awful change&mdash;and my physician
warns me that my lifework may end suddenly&mdash;he
is a fool who deals any other way than seriously
and honestly with the questions you discuss. If I
cannot say that your reasoning removes all my
doubts, I can most sincerely say this, even though
it may be, in your judgment, at the cost of my
consistency: <em>I would give the world to have your</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
<em>faith and hope</em>. While I have been glad to have
the arguments of Mr. &mdash;&mdash; to support my own
faith or want of faith, I will be candid and say
that I have not been at rest. Life has been terribly
empty and hopeless since I felt, with Professor
Clifford, that "the Great Companion is dead." I
have had success, as the world goes, but what of
it? What does it amount to? What is to be the
end of it all? No God! No immortality! Nothing
beyond this little circle whose utmost limit I
seem to be even now touching! Is it so?</p>

<p>I am writing at midnight&mdash;an hour when these
questions often come to me with the pressure of
despair. Oh to be a child again with a child's
faith, a child's peace! My mother&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here the letter ended. Did the thought of his
mother open the door of his aching heart to his
mother's God and his mother's Christ? So let us
hope. There is a mercy that is from everlasting to
everlasting upon them that fear God, and a righteousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that is unto children's children to such as
keep his covenant.</p>

<p>Lying upon the letter was the following slip, cut
from a newspaper. It was stained apparently with
tears, and was probably the last thing that my
friend read. It could hardly be the expression of
any heart to whom the "hand of mercy" was not
already "opening the wicket-gate:"</p>

<p>One has to breathe but little of the atmosphere
of popular thought to-day to find how full it is of
religious doubt. Parental faiths count for little.
The beliefs of childhood, the teachings of the
sainted dead, the hopes that once brightened the
darkness and mysteries and griefs of life with the
light of a cloudless future, are to multitudes no more.
"The eclipse of faith" has come, and souls are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
drifting out upon the starless, shoreless sea of unbelief.
They see "the spring sun shining out of
an empty heaven to light up a soulless earth."
They take up the wail of despair: "We are all to
be swept away in the final ruin of the earth."
This is the deep, pathetic undertone of the sighing
of a thousand hearts to-day.</p>

<p>Has life anything real? Is it worth living?
When the little play is over, and the hour's music is
ended, and the lights are out, and we go forth into
the darkness of the final night&mdash;what then? Is it
darkness for ever? or is there the light of an eternal
day? Who knows? Is anything certain?
Must nations and men and the evening-moth alike
go down and perish for ever under the crush of an
inexorable fate? Is there no rift in this cloud?
Have we no anchor that will hold as the storm
drives us on through the blinding mists and gloom
to the eternal shore? Have we no sure word of
promise to which we can cling when everything
else around us and under our feet is giving way?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Is the Bible true?</em> That is the simple but momentous
question; it settles all other questions of
most concern to men. To it, therefore, we find the
most intense thought of thoughtful men converging.
That from this there should emerge questions not
easily solved is not to be wondered at: they emerge
in every inquiry of human thought. The only
thing to be asked is that these questions be dealt
with candidly and fairly.</p>

<p>To many minds the Bible is still on trial; it is
only just that in its trial those rules and principles
shall be observed which men everywhere expect
and demand shall be observed for themselves when
they or their interests are to be tried.</p>

<p>This is the point of this essay. It is not,
indeed, a discussion from the highest ground of
inspiration; it does not claim to be. It simply
deals with a certain class&mdash;a very large class,
however&mdash;of alleged difficulties of the Bible, and
it appeals to the candid reader to deal with them as
fairly and by the same rules as he would have his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
fellow-men deal with him in a matter of life or
death, or of any worldly interest.</p>

<p>For this object only a few of the common rules
of evidence have been taken. It is believed, however,
that their application will cover a very large
portion of the popular objections to the alleged inconsistencies
and contradictions of the Bible.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, there are difficulties in the Bible;
the question is whether these prove that it is
not the work and word of God. On the other
hand, it may be suggested whether they do not
confirm it as the work of God, for they at once
put it in harmony with all his other works. If
the Bible were without difficulties, it would, for us,
be out of the line with everything else that God
has made or done. Nature and Providence are
full of difficulties. There is nothing in the Bible
harder of explanation and reconciliation than are
the facts that meet us everywhere in God's creative
and providential realms. If these difficulties do
not prove that Nature and Providence are not, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
beginning to end, the works of God, they do not on
the face of them prove that the Bible is not such.</p>

<p>In dealing with the difficulties of the Scriptures,
therefore, we have not the least idea that they will
all be removed: difficulties will remain. The Lord
of hosts himself is a stone of stumbling and a rock
of offence upon which many stumble and fall and
are broken. Isa. viii. 14, 15. If a man is determined
to commit suicide, he can do it by the very
means that God has created to preserve life&mdash;by
fire or by water. Spiritual self-destruction is quite
possible through the word of life itself. At the
same time, no man has a right to put needless difficulties
in the Bible or to make difficulties where
none exist. More than this, every man is bound
to deal as fairly at least with the Bible as he deals
with his fellow-men in the ordinary relations of
life. That which would give him no trouble as
a judge upon the bench or a juror in the box
ought not to be urged as a fatal objection to the
Scriptures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>In testing at this time some of the difficulties of
the Bible by the accepted rules of evidence, hardly
more can be done than to present a few of these
rules as applicable to these difficulties. But the
rules are of the widest application; the solution
of one difficulty by them is the solution of a
hundred.</p>

<p>Looking upon the Bible as a whole, we may
refer for a moment to the familiar precept that
every man is to be presumed innocent until he is
proved guilty. This is emphatically true of a man
of good general reputation. The rule would seem
as applicable to a book as to a man. Now, the
Bible is not a new book; it has been before the
world for ages. It has a character. That it is on
the whole a good book the bitterest opposers of its
plenary inspiration not only admit, but assert. It
is conceded that it is entitled to its name&mdash;the
<em>Bible</em>, <em>the</em> Book. It claims to be a truthful book;
by every fair principle this claim must be allowed
until it is shown to be false. Bancroft's <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span><cite>History
of the United States</cite> claims to be a reliable work;
the claim is generally admitted. If a man now
comes forward and asserts that it is false in whole
or in details, by universal judgment he must
prove his assertion, and obviously his proofs must
be stronger than the evidences of the truth of the
history. If this is so in reference to a book that
has not stood the test of half a century, emphatically
is it true of a book whose character has
been established through the searching scrutiny
of friends and foes for fifteen centuries&mdash;ay, for
twice fifteen centuries. If a man now affirms
the Bible to be false, wholly or in part, it rests
upon him in all fairness to prove his position, and
his evidence must be stronger than that which supports
the book. For three thousand years a growing
mass of testimony to the truth of the Bible
has been rolling up in the face of every objection
that ingenuity, learning and the bitterest hostility
could present. Account for it as we may, that is the
fact. There is, therefore, a reasonable presumption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
in its favor, and in favor of any specific statement
that it makes. If, then, we find in it a positive
statement in regard to any fact, and that statement
is now confronted by another and a contradictory
one, the two do not stand on the same level. The
new claimant must prove his position, and to prove
it he must disprove the truth of the Scripture
record. It is not enough to show that his proposition
might be true if we had no other information
on the subject: he must show that the Scripture,
with its mass of supporting and cumulative evidence,
is false; and he must support his new proposition
by a body of evidence stronger than this
manifold evidence of ages by which the Scriptures
are sustained.</p>

<p>The application of this principle is obvious, yet
nothing is more common than its violation. An
hypothesis with certain analogies perhaps in its
favor, but admittedly without a solitary positive
proof to sustain it, is put forward as an established
truth without regard to the fact that the Bible, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
its general character of veracity behind it, gives
another and an entirely different account of the
matter. We will not say this is irreverent: it is
unfair and unreasonable.</p>

<p>The character of the Bible may justly claim to
sustain its record till it is proved false. Deal with
it as fairly as you deal with the red-handed anarchist:
let the book be innocent till proved guilty;
and if innocent, the written word, like the incarnate
Word, stands a true witness in all things for
ever. Condemned, crucified, buried, it will rise
again. It is a perilous thing to condemn the
guiltless.</p>

<p>Let us pass to another rule of law; it is this:
"The testimony of a single witness, where there is
no ground for suspecting either his ability or integrity,
is a sufficient legal ground for belief"
(<cite>Starkie on Ev.</cite>, i. 550). The mere silence of one
witness or of many witnesses cannot set aside the
clear, positive testimony of a single trustworthy
witness. That Josephus does not mention events<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
which Moses records does not affect the truth of
the Mosaic record, and his silence as to the Bethlehem
massacre&mdash;even if no reason could be suggested
for it, as there can be&mdash;cannot, under this
rule of law, affect the positive testimony of Matthew
that there was such a massacre.</p>

<p>The courts go farther than this. They say, "If
a witness swear positively that he saw or heard a
fact, and another <em>who was present</em> that he did not
see or hear it, and the witnesses are equally faithworthy,
the affirmative witness is to be believed"
(<cite>Decisions of the Supreme Court of Errors of the
State of Connecticut</cite>, vol. vi. p. 188). In the case
referred to in that decision the court set aside a
verdict that had been rendered by the lower court
on the negative testimony of eleven witnesses against
the positive testimony of three. The principle
recognized by that decision, and which is universally
accepted as law, is that the negative testimony of
witnesses present at any given transaction cannot
set aside the positive testimony of a far less number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of witnesses, or even of a single reliable witness.</p>

<p>The silence of any of the evangelists in reference
to an incident or event at which they may have
been present, but which possibly they may not
have noticed or which they do not record, does not
contradict in the least the testimony of <em>one</em> who
says such an incident occurred. The fact of the
marriage in Cana is not at all disturbed because
John is the only witness who testifies to it. So if
one writer states a part of an incident or of a discourse
which another writer omits, while the latter
gives a part which the first omits, there is no contradiction.
Matthew (xx. 20) says the mother of
Zebedee's children made a certain request which
Mark (x. 35) says the children themselves made.
But this is not inconsistent: the children united
with the mother in the request. Matthew calls
attention to one party; Mark, to another. Nothing
can be more unreasonable than the cavil that
stumbles at such difficulties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The rule before us applies to that extraordinary
doubt of modern criticism&mdash;whether the Israelites
were ever in Egypt, because, as affirmed, the
monuments do not record their presence nor their
flight nor the destruction of the Egyptian host at
the Red Sea. Now, leaving out of the argument
the strong probability that the monuments do refer
to their presence in Egypt, and the further probability
that the Egyptians would not be likely to
preserve on their monuments the record of their
own ignominy and overthrow, the objection could
not stand for a moment in any court of justice in
the presence of the positive testimony of the
record to the history in Egypt&mdash;all the more as
this testimony is sustained by an extraordinary
weight of incidental corroborative evidence, and
is involved in the whole subsequent history of the
nation.</p>

<p>Grant, if you will, that there are improbabilities
in parts of the history; still, the courts rule that
"mere improbability can rarely supply a sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
ground for disbelieving direct and unexceptionable
witnesses of the fact where there was no room for
mistake" (<cite>Starkie</cite>, i. 558; see also <cite>Greenleaf on
Ev.</cite>, i. 1, 14, 15). That canon, fairly applied,
sweeps away no inconsiderable portion of the objections
to the Scripture histories. Take the great
decisive fact of the resurrection of Christ&mdash;a fact
that carries with it the whole Christian system and
the verity of the whole Christian revelation. It is
a fact of testimony&mdash;of the testimony of many
witnesses, under a great variety of circumstances,
at many times and places, and extending through
so long a period as to preclude all reasonable or
admissible supposition of "mistake." No fact of
ancient history can be proved by testimony if the
resurrection of Christ cannot be. The proof stands
by itself, positive, direct, unexceptionable as to the
character and capacity of the witnesses. It is proof
that the law declares cannot be set aside by "mere
improbability;" and if this fact is established,
everything essential to Christianity is established.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
The seal of the risen Christ is on the Old Testament;
his blood is on the New Testament. It is,
throughout, the living book of the slain and living
Lord.</p>

<p>Another very important rule of law is this: "In
cases of conflicting evidence, the first step in the
process of inquiry must naturally and obviously be
to ascertain whether the apparent inconsistencies and
incongruities which it presents may not without
violence be reconciled" (<cite>Starkie</cite>, i. 578). "Where
there is an apparent inconsistency or contradiction
in the testimony of witnesses, such construction
shall be put upon it as to make it agree if possible,
for perjury is not to be presumed" (<em>6 Conn.</em> 189).
Nothing is more remarkable than the constant violation
of this rule by many of the critics of the
Bible; their effort is to see, not if the testimony
can be made to agree, but if by any possibility
it can be forced to appear contradictory. It is
hardly putting it too strongly to say that many
of these efforts would not be considered respectable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and would not be tolerated by the critics
themselves, if they concerned any other book
than the Bible and any other subject than Christianity.</p>

<p>The courts take even stronger ground on the
obligation of harmonizing apparently conflicting
evidence. If the elements of reconciliation are not
found in the evidence itself, they insist on the admission
of any reasonable supposition that will explain
the difficulty.</p>

<p>"Where doubt arises," says Starkie (<cite>Ev.</cite> i. 586),
"from circumstances of an apparently opposite and
conflicting tendency, the first step in the natural
order of inquiry is to ascertain whether they be
not in reality reconcilable, especially when circumstances
cannot be rejected without imputing perjury
to a witness; for perjury is not to be presumed,
and in the absence of all suspicion that hypothesis
is to be adopted which consists with and reconciles
all the circumstances which the case supplies."

<p>Take the familiar case of the taxing when Cyrenius
was governor of Syria. Luke ii. 2. Everybody
knows how confidently it was asserted that
Luke was in error because Cyrenius' government
of Syria was several years later than Luke makes
it; equally, every one knows how that difficulty
was met by the supposition, made almost a certainty,
that Cyrenius was twice governor of Syria&mdash;once
at the time in question, and once later.
Even if the supposition were not as probable as it
is, if there were no other way of solving the difficulty,
we should be justified by the principle of law
in assuming it rather than to assume that a witness
as intelligent as Luke, and with his opportunities
of knowledge and with no motive for misstatement,
should either wilfully or carelessly have made so
gross an error. Here the rule fits perfectly: "In
the absence of all suspicion, <em>that hypothesis is to be
adopted which consists with and reconciles all the circumstances
which the case supplies</em>."</p>

<p>In regard to certain objections to the Mosaic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
record&mdash;for example, the improbability of the
desert sustaining the host of the Israelites: we
select this as an example of a mass of like objections&mdash;Dean
Stanley, while holding in general to
the historic fact, says the recorded miracles do not
meet the difficulty and we have no right to add to
them; for "if we have no warrant to take away,
we have no warrant to add." If by this he meant
we have no right to add to the inspired word <em>as a
part of it</em> what is not in it, he is quite correct; but
if he meant, as he evidently did, that we have no
right to make a reasonable supposition to explain
an apparent difficulty of the word, no utterance can
be more groundless. He might as well object that
Moses could not possibly have led the Israelites
through the desert forty years because no man
could do that without sleeping, and the record
does not say that Moses slept during all that
time, and "we have no warrant to add" to the
record.</p>

<p>The same difficulty is urged by others from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
present barrenness of the desert, which it is contended
is substantially as it was in the time of the
Exodus. This is to be met not so much by hypothesis
as by the facts&mdash;(1) that the condition of
the desert was very different then from its condition
now. Because the country around Philadelphia
cannot now support a tribe of Indians by hunting
and fishing, it does not follow that it could not do
this two hundred years ago. (2) God had undertaken
to bring the nation out. If every miracle
necessary to accomplish this end is not recorded, it
does not prove that it was not wrought. As in the
life of our Lord, so in the deliverance of Israel,
many miracles may have been wrought of which
no account has come down to us.</p>

<p>This suggests an obvious and a very important
consideration: <em>facts may now be missing</em> which were
perfectly well known at the time of the event, but
the record of which has not been preserved. Hence,
if a difficulty can be removed by a reasonable supposition,
or even by any admissible supposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of a missing fact, we are entitled to make that
supposition.</p>

<p>Webster (<cite>Works</cite>, vol. vi. p. 64) in his address to
the jury on the celebrated trial of the Knapps for
the murder of Captain White of Salem, Massachusetts,
says: "In explaining circumstances of evidence
which are apparently irreconcilable or unaccountable,
if a fact be suggested which at once
accounts for all and reconciles all, by whomsoever
it may be stated, it is still difficult not to believe
that such fact is the true fact belonging to the
case." The missing fact that was wanted in this
case to show a motive for the murder was the stealing
of a will, or the purpose to steal a will, and
this proved the true hypothesis.</p>

<p>To illustrate by a familiar incident of the Old
Testament history. The prophets Jeremiah and
Ezekiel foretell the fate of the last king of Judah,
Zedekiah. Jer. xxxii.; Ezek. xii. They declare that
he shall be taken captive by the king of Babylon,
that he shall go to Babylon and that he shall die in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Babylon; yet Ezekiel expressly says that he shall
not see Babylon. Now, here is apparently as gross
a contradiction as there can be; and if our information
stopped here, it would be impossible to reconcile
it. Fortunately, however, the explanation is
given in the history. From 2 Kings xxv. we learn
that the king of Babylon, when Zedekiah was
brought into his presence at Riblah, ordered his
eyes to be put out and sent him blind to Babylon;
so that he saw the king of Babylon, he went to
Babylon, he died in Babylon, and yet he never
saw Babylon. But&mdash;and this is the point of this
familiar case&mdash;if this unexpected and extraordinary
fact had not been stated, how absolutely impossible
it would have been to give any satisfactory solution
of the difficulty! It may be doubted whether
any supposition as violent as this needs to be
made to reconcile every alleged contradiction of the
Bible.</p>

<p>A remarkable illustration of the power of a missing
fact occurs in the history of the overthrow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Babylon itself. The Scripture account (Dan. v.)
says that Belshazzar was king of Babylon, that he
was in the city, engaged in a feast, at the time of
its capture, and that he was slain. Reliable secular
historians give the name of the king as Nabonnedus
or Labynetus, and state that he was not in
the city when it was captured, that he was not
killed, but taken prisoner, kindly treated and allowed
to retire to private life. These different
accounts were not only eagerly seized upon by
skeptics as proofs of the error of the Scriptures,
but even biblical scholars admitted them to be incapable
of reconciliation. No longer ago than
when the writer was in the theological seminary
that prince of biblical students, Addison Alexander,
said that no solution of the difficulty was known;
he was too wise a man to say that no solution was
possible. Kitto, in his <cite>Cyclopedia</cite>, declared that no
hypothesis <em>could</em> harmonize the accounts. Yet the
reconciliation was perfectly simple. A cylinder of
historic records discovered by Sir Henry Rawlinson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
in the ruins of Lower Babylon showed that there
were at this time two kings of Babylon, a father
and a son. One was occupying a stronghold near
the city, the other was defending the city itself;
the latter was taken and slain, the former was
spared. Thus, by the providential bringing to
light of a fact buried for centuries, that which had
seemed to be, and which had repeatedly and triumphantly
been proclaimed to be, and which had
been given up <em>as</em> being, an irreconcilable contradiction,
was shown to be perfectly harmonious. Yet
if the hypothesis of two kings had been suggested
as an explanation before the discovery of the fact,
it would have been hissed out of court by the whole
skeptical school.</p>

<p>The two accounts of the death of Judas have
not passed out of the field of popular objection.
Matthew (xxvii. 5) says he committed suicide; Luke
(Acts i. 18) says he fell headlong and burst asunder.
He does not say where he fell from or what were
the circumstances of the fall, and it is certainly not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
impossible, or even improbable, that both accounts
are true. The traitor hung himself, possibly, on
the verge of a precipice&mdash;the supposed spot furnishes
all the conditions for this&mdash;and afterward
(how long is not said) the rope or the limb of the
tree gave way, and he fell, striking first on the
rocks at the foot of the tree and then plunging
over the precipice with the result described by
Luke.</p>

<p>The case is not without a parallel. A few weeks
since the papers noticed the death of a gentleman
in one of our Western States. According to one
account, he perished in a railroad disaster; according
to another, he committed suicide&mdash;a contradiction
almost exactly like that in the case of Judas.
Yet there was no real discrepancy. With his wife
and child he was on the fatal train that met its
doom at Chatsworth. His child was killed; he
and his wife were taken from the ruins terribly
injured. The wife soon died; in despair, and with
no hope of his own life, he drew his pistol and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
sent the ball through his own head. He perished
in the Chatsworth disaster, and he committed
suicide.</p>

<p>The application of these principles of law&mdash;the
admission of any reasonable hypothesis, or of an
hypothesis that may seem <em>improbable</em>, if it removes
the difficulty, the supposition of missing facts
known at the time, but now lost&mdash;principles of constant
application in our courts of justice,&mdash;releases
at once the pressure from a large part of the objections
to the inspired record. The accounts of the
healing of the blind men at Jericho and the resurrection
of Christ&mdash;two of the most difficult of full
explanation in the New Testament&mdash;require no
more than this. It is not hard to present reasonable
hypotheses to meet the cases as they stand;
and if all the facts were known to us we believe
the harmony would be as complete and as simple
as that of the histories of the siege and capture of
Babylon.</p>

<p>We draw the discussion to a close with the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of the eminent American jurist and legal authority,
Professor Greenleaf: "All that Christianity [or
the Bible] asks of men on this subject is that
they would be consistent with themselves, that
they would treat its evidence as they treat the
evidence of other things, and that they would try
and judge its actors and witnesses as they deal with
their fellow-men when testifying to human affairs
and actions in human tribunals."</p>

<p>This, as we have said, is not the highest claim
that we can make for the Bible; but if men will go
as far as this, and deal with the alleged contradictions
of the book honestly by the common rules of
evidence, the vast majority of all the difficulties to
which these rules apply will disappear. In the
mean time, if there are those that do not yield to
present knowledge, we can afford to wait. Many
objections once supposed to be unanswerable have
been answered, and the process is going on. God
is very patient, but we may be assured that He
who just as the occasion has demanded has summoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
up the silent witnesses to his word from the
valley of the Nile, from the stormy cliffs of Sinai,
from the plains of Mesopotamia and from the sullen
shores of the Dead Sea, will not fail in the future
to give all the confirmation of his truth that the
faith of his Church may need.</p>
